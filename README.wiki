===What it is===
A simple template for my peronal (and anyone who wishes) use. Fits STM32F4, uses CMake as a build system.

===Required stuff===
* Cross-compiler. Make one by yourself using my instructions : http://www.iwasz.pl/electronics/toolchain-for-cortex-m4/
* CMake (the more recent, the better).
* STM32F4 Cube. It used to be named StdPeriph, and now they rebranded. 

===How to run===
Clone it, cd to the build directory and then:

<source lang="bash">
cd bouild
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make
make upload

#OR
./configure.sh
make
make upload
</source>
