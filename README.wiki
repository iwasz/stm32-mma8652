===Test circuit===
The IC has 10 pins @ 0.4mm pitch. I soldered this with regular chinese iron (chisel tip, 0.25mm solder with core and RF800 flux).

===Required stuff===
* Cross-compiler. Make one by yourself using my instructions : http://www.iwasz.pl/electronics/toolchain-for-cortex-m4/
* CMake (the more recent, the better).
* STM32F4 Cube. It used to be named StdPeriph, and now they rebranded. 

===How to run===
Clone it, cd to the build directory and then:

<source lang="bash">
cd build
cmake ..
make
make upload

#OR
./configure.sh
make
make upload
</source>
